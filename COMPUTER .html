      <h3> WHAT IS COMPUTER ENGINEERING? </h3> <br>
     <p > Computer engineering combines electrical engineering and computer science. It is about the interface between machines (hardware) and computers (software). Electrical engineers and computer engineers do both things, but computer engineers are more involved with software than electrical engineers. Computer engineers design and maintain hardware and software in computer-based systems, from PCs to supercomputers, as well as computer systems that are embedded in vehicles, appliances and communication networks. Specialized areas within computer engineering include system architecture, computer chip design, layout design, package/board design and system integration. CAREERS IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING Career opportunities for computer engineers are excellent across all specialties. A 2021 salary survey produced by Payscale.com found that computer engineering graduates earned an average base salary of $87,530. Computers are used increasingly to control electronic and mechanical hardware, so these students are held in high regard by local and international companies. Our students work for a diverse group of companies including Hewlett Packard, Schlumberger and CenterPoint Energy, as well as for petrochemical, construction and telecommunication companies
        Faculty and staff in the electrical and computer engineering department at the UH Cullen College of Engineering take pride in their commitment to undergraduate education. Students are treated as individuals and have access to faculty advisors throughout their undergraduate career. Small classes are the rule, especially at the junior and senior level. From the introductory level to the more advanced courses, teaching is done primarily by full-time faculty members, many of whom have received prestigious teaching awards. Students will receive real-world, hands-on training in the field to introduce them to electrical and computer engineering in an exciting and relevant way. In the senior design courses, students work on real-world problems with faculty and industry engineers guiding them. For those desiring additional learning opportunities, special workshops are available in some of the required freshman and sophomore courses 
        Students in the computer hardware stream will learn concepts of digital design at the gate and system/ architectural level. As an engineer you will research, develop, design, and test various computer equipment. This can range from circuit boards and micro-processors
        In the computer software stream students will learn the concepts of operating system structures, memory management, compilers, middleware, data structures, programming languages, databases, and security. As an engineer you will apply these skills to design, develop, and test software.
        Students in the computer systems stream will learn how to engineer complex systems and acquire an understanding of computers as an integration of software and hardware. As an engineer you will design and implement integrated computer systems for applications in such areas as robotics, artificial intelligence, aerospace and avionic systems, multimedia applications and cloud computing
        In the mechatronics stream students will learn about the applications of hardware and software for mechatronic systems, and students will also acquire additional knowledge related to sensors and actuators, machine vision, and aspects of modelling and control.
        Students in the artificial intelligence stream will learn about the theory of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning, and its practical uses. As an engineer you will design and implement AI methods such as deep learning and reinforcement learning to solve problems in natural language processing, computer vision, and ambient and affective computing, as well as applications to robotics, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent systems.
